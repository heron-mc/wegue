# Wegue App Dir
This directory will contain your Wegue Application.
By using the command `npm run init:app` this dir is populated with
the contents from the `app-starter` dir.

You can then place custom components under `components` here.
Static content like data, icons and css can be placed under static.
The default config file is `app-conf.json`.
